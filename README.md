## Scripts made during the contropedia sprint (Amsterdam 02/14)

The main script from which everything else runs is Ì€ get_page_revisions_infos.sh`:

```bash
bash get_page_revisions_infos.sh Global_warming
```

Or to work on the first 20 EMAPS examples:
```bash
for id in $(cat pageids.txt); do
  bash get_page_revisions_infos.sh "$id"
done
head -n 1 data/Global_warming/threads_matched.csv > data/threads_matched.csv
cat data/*/threads_matched.csv | grep -v "^article_title" >> data/threads_matched.csv
```
