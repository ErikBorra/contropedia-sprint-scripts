Global_warming,,"   <LF>   * Surprising or apparently important claims that are not widely known.   <LF>   * Surprising or apparently important reports of recent events not covered by reliable [[news media]].   <LF>   * Reports of a statement by someone that seems out of character, embarrassing, controversial, or against an interest they had previously defended.   <LF>   * Claims not supported or claims that are contradicted by the prevailing view in the relevant academic community. Be particularly careful when proponents say there is a [[conspiracy theory |conspiracy]] to silence them.    <LF>   Exceptional claims should be supported by multiple high quality reliable sources, especially regarding scientific or medical topics, historical events, politically charged issues, and in [[WP:BLP|material about living people]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;   <LF>   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:RS#Exceptional_claims_require_exceptional_sources   <LF>   The Newsweek article is definitely highly controversial, and it does assert that &quot;real science&quot; is being manhandled and covered up by &quot;corporate interests.&quot; It would be comparable to saying that as the article is sponsored by Philips (and it is), which has poured tens of thousands of dollars into the Newsweek for its construction, there is actually a big conspiracy to secretly fund environmentalists and produce such articles as these in order to scare people into buying expensive incandescent lightbulbs, whose production Philips has a huge stake in (see the following site in which Philips tells consumers that &quot;A simple act, like switching to an energy saving lamp, can have a powerful impact on our efforts to stem global warming.&quot; http://www.asimpleswitch.com/?country=us). As such, Philips loves these alarmist articles aimed at soccer moms in the Northeast who are most likely to buy its expensive lightbulbs.   <LF>   See? That's an extraordinary claim, and a piece in the Wall Street Journal or on James Inhofe's blog might certainly make it. The problem is, it's an awfully gussied up, conspiratorial charge. Does Philips have an economic stake in this issue? Of course. Would it prefer if everyone subscribed to the theory of catastrophic, anthropogenic global warming? Absolutely. Is your faith in my argument shaken when I tell you that in fact every article in Newsweek is currently sponsored by Philips, and that it's much more likely that this is a mere coincidence rather than a sneaky attempt to fund alarmist articles? It should be. The same applies with Newsweek's own claim. It omits facts and is utterly intent upon portraying an issue only one way. It has the tone of an opinion piece, and should certainly not be used to justify the assertion made in the original paragraph. It is an exceptional claim, and is an opinion. I suspect that a better paragraph would perhaps proceed as follows:   <LF>",TBD,2007-08-09,2007-08-09,1,1,1,12,4,3,8,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Global_warming/Archive_29#___.3CLF.3E___.2A_Surprising_or_apparently_important_claims_that_are_not_widely_known.___.3CLF.3E___.2A_Surprising_or_apparently_important_reports_of_recent_events_not_covered_by_reliable_.5B.5Bnews_media.5D.5D.___.3CLF.3E___.2A_Reports_of_a_statement_by_someone_that_seems_out_of_character.2C_embarrassing.2C_controversial.2C_or_against_an_interest_they_had_previously_defended.___.3CLF.3E___.2A_Claims_not_supported_or_claims_that_are_contradicted_by_the_prevailing_view_in_the_relevant_academic_community._Be_particularly_careful_when_proponents_say_there_is_a_.5B.5Bconspiracy_theory_.7Cconspiracy.5D.5D_to_silence_them.____.3CLF.3E___Exceptional_claims_should_be_supported_by_multiple_high_quality_reliable_sources.2C_especially_regarding_scientific_or_medical_topics.2C_historical_events.2C_politically_charged_issues.2C_and_in_.5B.5BWP.3ABLP.7Cmaterial_about_living_people.5D.5D..26lt.3B/blockquote.26gt.3B___.3CLF.3E___http.3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP.3ARS.23Exceptional_claims_require_exceptional_sources___.3CLF.3E___The_Newsweek_article_is_definitely_highly_controversial.2C_and_it_does_assert_that_.26quot.3Breal_science.26quot.3B_is_being_manhandled_and_covered_up_by_.26quot.3Bcorporate_interests..26quot.3B_It_would_be_comparable_to_saying_that_as_the_article_is_sponsored_by_Philips_.28and_it_is.29.2C_which_has_poured_tens_of_thousands_of_dollars_into_the_Newsweek_for_its_construction.2C_there_is_actually_a_big_conspiracy_to_secretly_fund_environmentalists_and_produce_such_articles_as_these_in_order_to_scare_people_into_buying_expensive_incandescent_lightbulbs.2C_whose_production_Philips_has_a_huge_stake_in_.28see_the_following_site_in_which_Philips_tells_consumers_that_.26quot.3BA_simple_act.2C_like_switching_to_an_energy_saving_lamp.2C_can_have_a_powerful_impact_on_our_efforts_to_stem_global_warming..26quot.3B_http.3A//www.asimpleswitch.com/.3Fcountry.3Dus.29._As_such.2C_Philips_loves_these_alarmist_articles_aimed_at_soccer_moms_in_the_Northeast_who_are_most_likely_to_buy_its_expensive_lightbulbs.___.3CLF.3E___See.3F_That.27s_an_extraordinary_claim.2C_and_a_piece_in_the_Wall_Street_Journal_or_on_James_Inhofe.27s_blog_might_certainly_make_it._The_problem_is.2C_it.27s_an_awfully_gussied_up.2C_conspiratorial_charge._Does_Philips_have_an_economic_stake_in_this_issue.3F_Of_course._Would_it_prefer_if_everyone_subscribed_to_the_theory_of_catastrophic.2C_anthropogenic_global_warming.3F_Absolutely._Is_your_faith_in_my_argument_shaken_when_I_tell_you_that_in_fact_every_article_in_Newsweek_is_currently_sponsored_by_Philips.2C_and_that_it.27s_much_more_likely_that_this_is_a_mere_coincidence_rather_than_a_sneaky_attempt_to_fund_alarmist_articles.3F_It_should_be._The_same_applies_with_Newsweek.27s_own_claim._It_omits_facts_and_is_utterly_intent_upon_portraying_an_issue_only_one_way._It_has_the_tone_of_an_opinion_piece.2C_and_should_certainly_not_be_used_to_justify_the_assertion_made_in_the_original_paragraph._It_is_an_exceptional_claim.2C_and_is_an_opinion._I_suspect_that_a_better_paragraph_would_perhaps_proceed_as_follows.3A___.3CLF.3E
